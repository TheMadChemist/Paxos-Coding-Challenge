Challenge #1

Challenge #2

The time complexity falls in line with the sorting algorithm in this case. Pythons sort uses Timsort, which has a worst
case of nlog(n). So the time complexity of the algorithm is nlog(n) as well.

A. Run the program with the --findTrio flag set. This solution is not sustainable for more items however. Say 4 items are
required, a dynamic programming solution will be more performant. 

B. If the file cannot be loaded into memory, you would hold the best solution in the same way. Then you would have 2
nested loops, one which opens the file, navigates to the next value that has yet to be used as the first, then the second
loop would iterate over the remaining values, checking if it forms a better solution and swapping it in if so.
